@CODE:

@TODO: Simplify the code to make it look clean and clear.


:::ISSUES/TODO:::

@Client & Server

@ISSUE: Deleting code on the client doesn't work correctly on the server (Unless my recent change fixed this)
@ISSUE: Once you press disconnect the client crashes
@ISSUE: After disconnecting and exiting the program might throw a Socket runtime error
@ISSUE: If the server goes down, the client will more than likely crash


@TODO: Deleting multiple (Selected) code won't be read by the server
@TODO: Free code where you want in the textbox without the line moving once you receive text from the server or client
@TODO: Make the server have a 'Stop Server' option once it has been started.

@UI

@UI: Perhaps make a better UI as this one is apparently too plain for some people. Wink, wink.
